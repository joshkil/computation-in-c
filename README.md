# Computing Foundations
Computing Foundations is a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZFaacJMNRm3JIn3nNR1cQ) for beginners who want to learn about computers, programming, and the math, science, and art behing this world changing field of knowledge. 

## How this Repository is Organized
Many of the videos in the Computing Foundations channel have an accompanying example program. The program is referenced in the video description. All programs begin with a two digit number making them easier to refer to and order. The special file name XX-challenge.c (where XX is a 2 digit number) is reserved for example solutions to programming challenges that are given on the channel. 

## Guide to the Videos
If you want a comprehensive journey through basic programming, here is a list of the videos in order.
